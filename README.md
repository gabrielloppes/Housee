## **Project Description**
This project was inspired in my team's final project for [Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) called [Unaconsulta](https://github.com/mamuh/unaconsulta) a service where tenants can leave reviews on properties or rooms they've lived in. The main idea for Housee is to implement the same idea but bringing TDD, better functionalities and a brand-new UX and UI
